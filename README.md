In the pursuit of my thesis, I've undertaken an exhilarating journey, exploring a multitude of cutting-edge techniques encompassing Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Transformer Learning, and Ensemble Models. Among the challenges I've embraced, the renowned 'LIAR' dataset initially stood with an accuracy of just 27%. However, through my dedication and effort, I've managed to significantly enhance its overall performance. Additionally, I've ventured into other intriguing datasets like ISOT, BuzzFeed, and Covid Tweet. It's essential to emphasize that this endeavor represents an ever-evolving research expedition, with frequent updates to come, underscoring my unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge.
